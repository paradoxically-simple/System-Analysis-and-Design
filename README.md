# System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

DriverPass is a small business start up that wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road 
training to better prepare them for driving tests. The initial interview provided the needs and capabilities of the company. 
Setting Driver Pass up with Digital Ocean droplet virtual machines was the best design for this client. Allowing for simple 
management by the Driver Pass IT technician, Digital Ocean can grow or shrink with the company and provide as much or as little
for Driver Pass as desired. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The client has a good idea for a small start up company that provides value and fills a need in the market. Driver Pass can be 
built as requested but there is another option where unlimited expansion could be built into the system and instead of hired 
instructors, Driver Pass could screen and contract freelance instructors that would set up their own price, schedule, appointments
and Driver Pass would only be responsible for the website/mobile application. This model has been proven with taxi companies like 
Uber or Lyft. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider 
the user’s needs when designing?

Driver Pass indicated they did not want to handle backup or security. They also had a desire to be cloud hosted. With those requirements 
in mind the system will rely on Digital Oceans virtual machines to take care of the hosting, database storage and offers the flexibility 
to expand or reduce down to a free service with the needs of Driver Pass. It is vitally important to adhere to a clients needs because in 
this case, Driver Pass doesn’t have the physical servers or technical professionals to run the parts of their system that will be handled 
by Digital Ocean. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Beginning with the client interview, adding any user stories or other non technical documentation, a list of functional and non functional 
requirements can be created. Once the scope of the project is realized, work can be split up and assigned according to a gnat chart or backlog 
items list depending on the project management style. I prefer the Agile method where different teams can be working their own sections and 
deliverables are reviewed by the client and stakeholders to ensure progress is being made to fulfill the vision of the client. Wire framing 
the user interface with descriptions of the various functions and limitations is another invaluable tool that will keep the project moving 
forward and the client involved.
